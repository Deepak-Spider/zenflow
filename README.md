# User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience

ZenFlow is aimed at individuals looking for a path to self-improvement. Its target audience includes people seeking effective stress management, meditation enthusiasts, wellness and self-care advocates, sleep-deprived individuals looking for relaxation techniques, and yoga and Tai Chi practitioners seeking a synergistic approach to mindful movement.

## User Stories

* As a new visitor to the ZenFlow website, I want to be greeted by a visually captivating Hero image and a warm welcoming message that clearly communicates the purpose of the platform. I expect easy navigation with a responsive menu, allowing seamless access to key sections like Home, Programs, and Join Us. Scrolling down, I look forward to discovering compelling reasons to join a mindfulness program and gaining insights about ZenFlow through an engaging 'About Us' section. The footer should provide essential contact information and links to social media, creating a holistic and inviting user experience.

 * As a user exploring ZenFlow's Programs Page, I seek a clear and captivating heading that introduces me to the array of mindfulness programs offered. I expect a brief yet informative description that highlights the overall purpose and benefits of the programs. Scrolling down, I anticipate discovering four distinct programs, each presented with engaging detailsâ€”such as their goals, objectives, and unique features. The information should be concise, making it easy for me to grasp the essence of each program quickly. As a potential participant, I'm eager to find a program that resonates with my goals for mindfulness and self-improvement.

* As a user interested in joining the ZenFlow mindfulness program, I navigate to the 'Join Us' page seeking a seamless and user-friendly experience. I expect a form  on the page, enticing me to share my details for ZenFlow to contact me for discussion. The submission process should be straightforward, allowing me to provide my information efficiently. Upon successful submission, I look forward to being redirected to a Thank You page where I receive a warm and appreciative message from ZenFlow, assuring me that my interest is valued. The page should also provide information on what to expect next and how I can further engage with the ZenFlow community.

## Design Wireframes

The design and structure for this website was created in Balsamiq

![Home Page Low Fidelity Wireframne](docs/screenshots/Home.png)

## Site Structure

The ZenFlow website comprises three pages that users can easily navigate using the navigation bar. On the Home Page, which is the default loading page, there is a header with site branding featuring the logo positioned at the top left, which can be clicked to return to the Home Page. On the right-hand side, there are navigation links for Programs and Join Us

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The website uses a mindful color palette that contributes to a comfortable and enjoyable browsing experience, aligning with the principles of mindfulness. 

Images used  are carefully chosen with nature-inspired neutrals and gently muted color palettes to create a calm, peaceful, and positive atmosphere, fostering a sense of serenity and harmony.

Logo (#333333 (Charcoal) and Text Color (Calm Grays ) : Ensures optimal contrast for readability while maintaining a calming tone.

Call-to-Action Button (#454B1B) Thatch Green: Draws attention to important elements like buttons, encouraging user interaction

In summary, the color palette aims to create a visually soothing environment, aligning with the calming and transformative nature of mindfulness practices. It provides a good balance between professionalism and approachability. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility and enhances the overall user experience and engagement.

### Typography
Heading font: Open Sans and Body Font: Nunito (Regular)
Open Sans and Nunito are both highly readable fonts. The boldness of Open Sans enhances visibility for headings, while the regular weight of Nunito ensures comfortable reading for longer bodies of text. Both fonts have a clean and modern aesthetic, aligning with the principles of mindfulness that often emphasize simplicity and clarity.

# Features

ZenFlow's website has been thoughtfully structured to offer users a smooth and intuitive experience across its three main pages. It's designed to be user-friendly and entice the user to explore further.
Each page, with the exception of the Home Page, features a distinct heading. The program page provides a title for each program along with a brief description. The language, colors, and design are chosen to be approachable and easily comprehensible.


## Navigation

A dynamic navigation menu ensures smooth navigation across the website. It adapts to different screen sizes, offering three variations for optimal user experience. The mobile navigation menu is a burger menu.

## Home Page

The homepage serves as the welcoming gateway to ZenFlow, enticing visitors with compelling reasons to embark on a mindfulness journey. 

The Home Page is the landing page of the website and the first part that the user will see. It is designed to be welcoming and the purpose of the website easily understood.The hero section features an aesthetically pleasing image associated with mindfulness. Overlaying the hero image are the site name and a catchy slogan.

The second fold section highlights the transformative benefits of joining the program and below that section is a brief introduction about ZenFlow's ethos and mission. The page seamlessly blends persuasive copy with captivating visuals, inviting users to explore the profound possibilities of mindful living.

Each section is fully responsive, with the multiple column content naturally falling into single column content.

## Programs Page

The second page delves into the heart of ZenFlow, offering an in-depth exploration of the diverse programs available. Each program, from Guided Meditation Sessions to Stress Management and Mindful Movement, provides a comprehensive overview of the transformative content awaiting those who choose to join ZenFlow.

## Join Us Page

The user should land on the Join Us page when looking to get in touch with the business.

The  contact form follows the standard layout, featuring three input fields: First Name, Last Name, and Email Address. Submission of the contact form is contingent on correctly filling out the required fields, enforced by the necessary attribute.

Additionally, the form utilises a GET function to direct users to a Thank You page, simulating the form submission completion. It's important to note that no actual information is transmitted upon form completion, and the thank you page is purely illustrative of the user's interaction with the form.

## Thank You Page
The Thank You page isn't accessible through any links on the website. It is visible after submitting  the contact form on the Join Us  page, utilizing a GET function to retrieve the page and confirm the contact form submission.

The website maintains a consistent style and design, featuring a top navigation bar and a bottom footer. This setup enables users to easily navigate back to the main website.

## Footer

The footer, a constant presence across all pages, houses social media links. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Instagram links on this website only link to the home pages of the sites and are solely for educational purposes.
