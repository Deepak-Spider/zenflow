# User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience

ZenFlow is aimed at individuals looking for a path to self-improvement. Its target audience includes people seeking effective stress management, meditation enthusiasts, wellness and self-care advocates, sleep-deprived individuals looking for relaxation techniques, and yoga and Tai Chi practitioners seeking a synergistic approach to mindful movement.

## User Stories

* As a new visitor to the ZenFlow website, I want to be greeted by a visually captivating Hero image and a warm welcoming message that clearly communicates the purpose of the platform. I expect easy navigation with a responsive menu, allowing seamless access to key sections like Home, Programs, and Join Us. Scrolling down, I look forward to discovering compelling reasons to join a mindfulness program and gaining insights about ZenFlow through an engaging 'About Us' section. The footer should provide links to social media, creating a holistic and inviting user experience.

 * As a user exploring ZenFlow's Programs Page, I seek a clear heading and a brief yet informative description that highlights the overall purpose and benefits of the programs. Scrolling down, I anticipate discovering four distinct programs, each presented with concise information. As a potential participant, I'm eager to find a program that resonates with my goals for mindfulness and self-improvement.

* As a user interested in joining the ZenFlow mindfulness program, I navigate to the 'Join Us' page seeking a seamless and user-friendly experience. I expect a form  on the page, enticing me to share my details for ZenFlow to contact me for discussion. The submission process should be straightforward, allowing me to provide my information efficiently. Upon successful submission, I look forward to being redirected to a 'Thank You' page where I receive a warm and appreciative message from ZenFlow, assuring me that my interest is valued. The page should also provide information on what to expect next.

## Design Wireframes

The design and structure for this website was created in Balsamiq

![Home Page Low Fidelity Wireframne](docs/screenshots/wireframe.png)

## Site Structure

The ZenFlow website comprises three pages that users can easily navigate using the navigation bar and a thank you page that can only be accessed by submitting the contact form on the join us page . On the Home Page, which is the default loading page, there is a header with site branding featuring the logo positioned at the top left, which can be clicked to return to the Home Page. On the right-hand side, below the header, there are navigation links for Programs and Join Us page.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The website uses a mindful color palette that contributes to a comfortable and enjoyable browsing experience, aligning with the principles of mindfulness. 

Images used  are carefully chosen with nature-inspired neutrals and gently muted color palettes to create a calm, peaceful, and positive atmosphere, fostering a sense of serenity and harmony.

Logo (#333333 (Charcoal) and Text Color (#3A3A3A) (Calm Grays ) : Ensures optimal contrast for readability while maintaining a calming tone.

Call-to-Action Button (#454B1B) (Thatch Green): Draws attention to buttons, encouraging user interaction.

In summary, the color palette aims to create a visually soothing environment, aligning with the calming and transformative nature of mindfulness practices. It provides a good balance between professionalism and approachability. It also ensures sufficient contrast for accessibility and enhances the overall user experience and engagement.

### Typography
Heading font is Open Sans and Body Font is Nunito.
Open Sans and Nunito are both highly readable fonts. The boldness of Open Sans enhances visibility for headings and logo, while the regular weight of Nunito ensures comfortable reading for longer bodies of text. Both fonts have a clean and modern aesthetic, aligning with the principles of mindfulness that often emphasize simplicity and clarity.

Each section is fully responsive, with the multiple column content naturally falling into single column content.

The  contact form follows the standard layout, featuring three input fields: First Name, Last Name, and Email Address. Submission of the contact form is straight forward on correctly filling out the required fields.

Additionally, the form utilises a GET function to direct users to a Thank You page, simulating the form submission completion. It's important to note that no actual information is transmitted upon form completion, and the thank you page is purely illustrative of the user's interaction with the form.

## Thank You Page
The Thank You page isn't accessible through any links on the website. It is visible after submitting  the contact form on the Join Us  page, utilizing a GET function to retrieve the page and confirm the contact form submission.
